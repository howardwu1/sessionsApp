    "readme": "# react-native-safe-area-view\n\nThis is a JS-only version of React Native's SafeAreaView, it adds a small api that makes SafeAreaView more flexible for complex UIs.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install react-native-safe-area-view\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nWrap components that touch any edge of the screen with SafeAreaView.\n\n```jsx\n<SafeAreaView>\n  <View>\n    <Text>Look, I'm safe!</Text>\n  </View>\n</SafeAreaView>\n```\n\nGet height of a specific side from the SafeArea.\n\n```jsx\n...\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');\nimport { getInset } from 'react-native-safe-area-view';\n\nconst landScape = width > height;\nconst bottomPadding = getInset('bottom', landScape);\n```\n\n### forceInset\n\nSometimes you will observe unexpected behavior and jank because SafeAreaView uses `onLayout` then calls `measureInWindow` on the view. If you know your view will touch certain edges, use `forceInset` to force it to apply the inset padding on the view.\n\n```jsx\n<SafeAreaView forceInset={{ top: 'always' }}>\n  <View>\n    <Text>Yeah, I'm safe too!</Text>\n  </View>\n</SafeAreaView>\n```\n\n`forceInset` takes an object with the keys `top | bottom | left | right | vertical | horizontal` and the values `'always' | 'never'`. Or you can override the padding altogether by passing an integer.\n\n### With HOC\n\nSometimes you would prefer to use a higher-order component to wrap components.\n\n```js\nwithSafeArea()(Component);\n\n// Or with forceInset props\nwithSafeArea({ top: 'always' })(Component);\n```\n",
