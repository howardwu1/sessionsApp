Clone the repo, go to the Example/ folder and run:\n\n```\nyarn install\n```\n\nThen run `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios` (depending on which platform you want to run the example app on).\n\nYou will need to have an Android or iOS device or emulator connected as well as react-native-cli package installed globally.\n\n## License\n\nReanimated library is licensed under [The MIT License](LICENSE).\n\n## Credits\n\nThis project is supported by amazing people from [Expo.io](https://expo.io) and [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com)\n\n[![expo](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12504344?v=3&s=100 'Expo.io')](https://expo.io)\n[![swm](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6952717?v=3&s=100 'Software Mansion')](https://swmansion.com)\n",
