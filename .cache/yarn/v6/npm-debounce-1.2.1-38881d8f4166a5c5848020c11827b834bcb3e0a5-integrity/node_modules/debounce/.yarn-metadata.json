    "readme": "\n# debounce\n\n  Useful for implementing behavior that should only happen after a repeated\n  action has completed.\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ component install component/debounce\n\n  Or in node:\n\n    $ npm install debounce\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nvar debounce = require('debounce');\nwindow.onresize = debounce(resize, 200);\n\nfunction resize(e) {\n  console.log('height', window.innerHeight);\n  console.log('width', window.innerWidth);\n}\n```\n\nTo later clear the timer and cancel currently scheduled executions:\n```\nwindow.onresize.clear();\n```\n\nTo execute any pending invocations and reset the timer:\n```\nwindow.onresize.flush();\n```\n\nAlternately, if using newer syntax:\n\n```js\nimport { debounce } from \"debounce\";\n```\n\n## API\n\n### debounce(fn, wait, [ immediate || false ])\n\n  Creates and returns a new debounced version of the passed function that\n  will postpone its execution until after wait milliseconds have elapsed\n  since the last time it was invoked.\n\n  Pass `true` for the `immediate` parameter to cause debounce to trigger\n  the function on the leading edge instead of the trailing edge of the wait\n  interval. Useful in circumstances like preventing accidental double-clicks\n  on a \"submit\" button from firing a second time.\n\n  The debounced function returned has a property 'clear' that is a \n  function that will clear any scheduled future executions of your function.\n\n  The debounced function returned has a property 'flush' that is a \n  function that will immediately execute the function if and only if execution is scheduled,\n  and reset the execution timer for subsequent invocations of the debounced\n  function.\n\n## License\n\n  MIT\n\n  Original implementation is from [`underscore.js`](http://underscorejs.org/)\n  which also has an MIT license.\n",
