    "readme": "# `@expo/image-utils`\n\nA library for image processing functionality in Expo CLI. It uses `sharp` for image processing if it's available through a global `sharp-cli` installation. Otherwise it uses `jimp`, a Node library with no native dependencies, and warns the user that they may want to install `sharp-cli` for faster image processing.\n\n## Advanced Configuration\n\nThis package can be configured using the following environment variables.\n\n### EXPO_IMAGE_UTILS_NO_SHARP\n\nWhen truthy, this will force global `sharp-cli` resolution methods like `isAvailableAsync()` and `findSharpInstanceAsync()` to fail. Other processes can use this to fallback on Jimp for image modifications. By default this is falsy (undefined).\n\n`findSharpInstanceAsync()` will throw an error if disabled because it shouldn't be invoked if `isAvailableAsync()` returns `false`.\n",
