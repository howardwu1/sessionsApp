    "readme": "# Badgin\n\nThe [Badging API](https://web.dev/badging-api/) is a new web platform API that allows installed web apps to set an application-wide badge, shown in an operating-system-specific place associated with the application (such as the shelf or home screen). The Badging API works on Windows, and macOS, in Chrome 81 or later. It has also been confirmed to work on Edge 84 or later. Support for Chrome OS is in development and will be available in a future release of Chrome. On Android, the Badging API is not supported. Instead, Android automatically shows a badge on app icon for the installed web app when there is an unread notification, just as for Android apps. Since this API is not available everywhere, `badgin` safely falls back to alternatives.\n\n## via badge\n\nCurrently, the native badge is only displayed if you install the web application to your home screen (view [prerequisites](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners)). The screenshot shows the application in the dock of macOS.\n\n![](https://github.com/jaulz/badgin/raw/master/assets/screenshots/standalone_osx.png)\n\n## via favicon\n\nIf the native badge is not available, the favicon will be used and a small badge will be added.\n\n![](https://github.com/jaulz/badgin/raw/master/assets/screenshots/favicon.png)\n\n## via title\n\nIf the favicon is not available, the badge will be added as a prefix to the title.\n\n![](https://github.com/jaulz/badgin/raw/master/assets/screenshots/title.png)\n\n## Demo\n\nYou can find a demo at https://jaulz.github.io/badgin/ where you can see the different options. If you want to see the native badge, you need to install the app to your home screen (check out the plus icon in the address bar).\n\n## Installation\n\nThe module can be installed by running:\n\n```\nyarn add --save badgin\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nJust use the library as following:\n\n```js\nimport badgin from 'badgin'\n\nbadgin.set(1) // set value\nbadgin.set() // set indicator only\nbadgin.clear()\n```\n\n### Options\n\nThe following options can be used:\n\n```js\n{\n  method: 'Badging' | 'Favicon' | 'Title'\n  favicon: {\n    backgroundColor: string = '#424242'\n    color: string = '#ffffff'\n    indicator: string = '!'\n    radius: number = 3\n    size: number = 7\n    horizontalMargin: number = 0\n    verticalMargin: number = 0\n    horizontalPadding: number = 1\n    verticalPadding: number = 1\n  }\n  title: {\n    indicator: string = '!'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd you can use it like this:\n\n```js\nbadgin.set(1, {\n  favicon: {\n    width: 9,\n    background: '#549A2F',\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## License / Credits\n\nMIT\n\nThis is a refactored fork of the original Tinycon library, Tinycon is released under the MIT license. Tinycon was inspired by [Notificon](https://github.com/makeable/Notificon).\n"
