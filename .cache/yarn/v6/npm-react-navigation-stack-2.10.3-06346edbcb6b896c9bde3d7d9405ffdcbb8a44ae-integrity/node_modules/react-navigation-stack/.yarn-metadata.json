If you need to make changes, please send a pull request there.\n\nIf the change is specifically related to React Navigation 4 integration, first run `yarn patch:apply`, then change the files in `src/vendor` to resolve any conflicts and then run `yarn patch:create` to update the patch file with the latest changes.\n\nMake sure your code passes TypeScript and ESLint. Run the following to verify:\n\n```sh\nyarn typescript\nyarn lint\n```\n\nTo fix formatting errors, run the following:\n\n```sh\nyarn lint --fix\n```\n\n## Docs\n\nDocumentation can be found on the [React Navigation website](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/stack-navigator.html).\n\n<!-- badges -->\n\n[build-badge]: https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/react-navigation/stack/master.svg?style=flat-square\n[build]: https://circleci.com/gh/react-navigation/stack\n[version-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-navigation-stack.svg?style=flat-square\n[package]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-navigation-stack\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/l/react-navigation-stack.svg?style=flat-square\n[license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n",
